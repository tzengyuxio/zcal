## Definitions

### Julian Day Number

From "Julian Day - Wikipedia":

> The Julian Day Number (JDN) is the integer assigned to a whole solar day in
the Julian day count starting from noon Greenwich Mean Time, with Julian day 
number 0 assigned to the day starting at noon on January 1, 4713 BC, proleptic 
Julian calendar (November 24, 4714 BC, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar).

### Western Calendar

For a common calendar usage, **Western Calendar** means using Gregorian Calendar
after October 1582, 97 leaps in 400 years. On the other hand, Julian Calendar is
used before and including September 1582, one leap every 4 years.

There is no "0 year" in Western Calendar notation, the previous year of 1 AD/CE
is `-1` (BC 1).
